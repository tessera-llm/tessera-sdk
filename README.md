# Tessera SDK — drop-in LLM cost-optimization proxy

Tessera is an LLM gateway that sits in your request path. It auto-routes to cheaper-equivalent models, caches repeated prompts, compresses context, and batches eligible calls. Every request is measured for cost delta against the model you originally asked for. **You keep 80% of the measured savings. We take 20%. Zero savings = zero fee.**

## Who this is for

- **AI-native SaaS** spending $5k+/month on OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini and wanting that bill cut without re-architecting.
- **Vertical AI agents** (sales, support, voice, customer success) where margin compresses as call volume scales.
- **Engineering teams** who want an honest cost-reduction layer, not another observability dashboard.

**Not for:** hobby projects under $500/month bills — the free tier already covers you. Air-gapped on-prem deployments — we're hosted only.

---

## Install

| Language | Install |
|---|---|
| Python | `pip install "tessera-llm-proxy>=0.1.0,<0.2"` |
| Node / TypeScript | `npm install @tessera-llm/sdk@^0.1.0` |

Pre-1.0 semver: minor releases may include breaking changes. Pin a floor + ceiling in production.

## One-line integration

### Python

```python
import tessera
tessera.activate("tk_your_tessera_key")

# Existing code runs unchanged. Any openai.OpenAI(), anthropic.Anthropic(),
# mistralai.Mistral(), groq.Groq(), cohere.Client() constructed AFTER this
# call routes through Tessera transparently. Your provider keys stay in
# the environment as usual.
```

### Node / TypeScript

```ts
import { activate } from "@tessera-llm/sdk";
activate("tk_your_tessera_key");

// Same shape: new OpenAI(), new Anthropic(), new Mistral(), etc. — all
// patched at load time. Bring-your-own provider keys.
```

---

## 30-second curl test

Get your key first at [tesseraai.io/dev](https://tesseraai.io/dev) — takes a minute, no card. Then:

```bash
curl https://api.tesseraai.io/v1/openai/chat/completions \
  -H "X-Tessera-Key: tk_<your-free-key>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-<your-openai-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'

# Response shape = plain OpenAI. Behind the scenes: route + cache + compress + batch.
# Savings counter ticks live at ledger.tesseraai.io/portal.
```

---

## Worked example — what 20% of savings looks like

**TL;DR — a customer-support agent burning $24,000/month on `gpt-4o` nets $11,680/month back after our 20% fee. Quality canary held at 0.96 across all four mechanics.**

A customer-support AI agent runs on `gpt-4o` with high prompt repetition (FAQ-style queries). 5B tokens / month at OpenAI list prices (70% input @ $2.50/M, 30% output @ $10/M) sits around **$24,000/month** at the start of the period.

After enabling Tessera (no code change beyond one-line activate):

| Stage | Cost / month | Savings |
|---|---:|---:|
| Baseline (OpenAI direct) | $24,000 | — |
| + auto-cache (35% hit rate on FAQ prefix) | $15,600 | $8,400 |
| + auto-route (`gpt-4o → gpt-4o-mini` where quality canary holds) | $11,520 | $4,080 |
| + prompt cache (OpenAI cached-input rate, 50% off cached prefix) | $10,200 | $1,320 |
| + context pruning (RAG trim) | $9,400 | $800 |
| **Tessera-optimized total** | **$9,400** | **$14,600 / month** |
| **Tessera fee (20% of savings)** | $2,920 | — |
| **Customer net** | **$12,320** | **$11,680 saved / month** |

Quality canary mean-score held at 0.96 across all stages (floor 0.95) — if it had dropped, the auto-route mechanic would have rolled back automatically and the customer received a 10% SLA credit on the affected days. **Numbers vary by workload shape.** Run your own workload free for 60M tokens to measure your actual delta.

---

## What Tessera does to each request

Eight mechanics shipped, two more in design (`m4` cost-attribution batching, `m9` multi-region failover — see the [roadmap](https://tesseraai.io/how-it-works)). Each mechanic is per-workload opt-in. Stage 3 mutex caps content-mutating mechanics at one per request to bound quality risk.

Audit-log chips in `/portal/audit` use the short codes in `<sub>` below — that's the bridge if you want to map a specific request back to which mechanic fired.

| Mechanic | What it does | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Auto-route** <sub>(m1)</sub> | Swap requested model for a cheaper-equivalent in the same family (e.g. `gpt-4o → gpt-4o-mini`) when quality canary holds ≥ 0.95 | 30–60% cost cut on most routed calls; up to 95% on the largest tier drops |
| **Auto-cache** <sub>(m2)</sub> | Exact-match KV cache for repeated prompts within TTL | Up to 100% on cache hits |
| **Auto-compress** <sub>(m3)</sub> | Whitespace and structural normalization only — preserves code fences and JSON value ranges. We never paraphrase your text. Per-role opt-in (system prompts and / or user turns) | 5–15% prompt size reduction |
| **Semantic cache** <sub>(m5)</sub> | Embedding-based similarity cache (cosine ≥ 0.95) for near-duplicate prompts | Up to 100% on semantic hits |
| **Prompt cache** <sub>(m6)</sub> | Native provider prompt-cache headers — OpenAI cached-input rate (50% off), Anthropic prompt caching (90% off cache reads) | 50–90% on cached prefixes depending on provider |
| **Context pruning** <sub>(m7)</sub> | Conversation + RAG-block aware prune when message count > 12 or body > 32 KB | 10–40% prompt token reduction |
| **Structured output** <sub>(m8)</sub> | Inject `response_format=json_schema` (strict mode) or `json_object` (auto mode) when an `expected_schema` is set | 10–35% output cost cut on JSON workloads |
| **Auto-batch** <sub>(m10)</sub> | Route async-tolerant calls to provider Batch APIs (OpenAI Batch, Anthropic Message Batches — both 50% off) | 50% on batch-eligible traffic |

---

## Quality SLA — auto-rollback + 10% credit

A canary runs your workload at 10% sample rate against the baseline model, scored by a [promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev) eval set you can define. If a workload's stack mean-score drops below 0.95 for 3 consecutive days with at least 30 samples per stack:

1. The specific stack (e.g. `m1+m7`) auto-disables. `m1` alone and `m7` alone stay live — surgical rollback, not nuclear.
2. A 10% credit on the last 3 days' fees attributable to that stack lands on your prepaid balance automatically.
3. An `audit_event` records the breach + credit + reactivation timeline in your `/portal/audit` ledger.

You can also flip the global kill-switch in `/portal/billing` at any time — traffic continues flowing as passthrough, just with no mutation.

---

## How it works (60 seconds)

1. **Get a free API key** — email + ToS at [ledger.tesseraai.io/signup-dev](https://ledger.tesseraai.io/signup-dev). You receive a `tk_` key (shown once) plus a magic-link for dashboard access (we use passwordless email auth — no SSO yet, on the roadmap).
2. **Install the SDK** — `pip install tessera-llm-proxy` or `npm install @tessera-llm/sdk`.
3. **One line** — `tessera.activate("tk_…")` (Python) or `activate("tk_…")` (Node).
4. **Watch the counter** — tokens used + savings number tick live on [ledger.tesseraai.io/portal](https://ledger.tesseraai.io/portal).

Provider keys (your OpenAI `sk-…`, Anthropic `sk-ant-…`, etc.) stay in your environment. Tessera forwards them upstream untouched. We never store your prompts or completions — only token counts and cost deltas. See the [data privacy FAQ](#do-you-store-my-prompts-or-completions) below.

## Pricing

| | **Free Dev** | **Production** |
|---|---|---|
| Token throughput | 60M / month | Unlimited |
| Rate limit | 10 req / min | 60 req / min |
| Performance fee | $0 | **20%** of measured savings · $0 if none |
| Balance management | — | Stripe top-ups ($100 min) |
| Monthly savings statement | — | Audit-grade PDF |
| Anomaly response | Read-only alerts | Auto-throttle on cost spike, auto-halt on runaway |
| Team seats | — | Up to 5 |

**You keep 80% of measured savings. We take 20%.** If a period yields no measured saving, you pay nothing for that period. The kill-switch in `/portal/billing` pauses optimization any time; traffic still flows passthrough.

Upgrade flow: start free, then upgrade inside the dashboard once the savings counter is moving — no separate signup. Full terms: [tesseraai.io/terms](https://tesseraai.io/terms).

## Compared to LLM observability tools

| | **Tessera** | LLM observability tools |
|---|---|---|
| Position | Substrate proxy in request path | Observability sidecar |
| Optimization | Does it (route, cache, compress, batch in real time) | Surfaces charts, no real-time mutation |
| Engineer effort | Two headers, that's it | Set up tracing + dashboards |
| Billing model | 20% of measured savings | Per-seat or per-event subscriptions |
| Co-existence | Yes — observability tools still get your telemetry downstream | Complementary |

## Frameworks & examples

The [examples/](./examples/) directory has runnable snippets:

- [`openai-wrap.py`](./examples/openai-wrap.py) — OpenAI client (Python)
- [`openai-wrap.ts`](./examples/openai-wrap.ts) — OpenAI client (Node)
- [`anthropic-wrap.py`](./examples/anthropic-wrap.py) — Anthropic client
- [`langchain-wrap.py`](./examples/langchain-wrap.py) — LangChain (no adapter needed — activation patches the underlying SDK)
- [`direct-provider.py`](./examples/direct-provider.py) — DeepSeek, Together, Fireworks, etc. via OpenAI-compatible URL

Compatible with LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, AutoGen, Mastra, Pydantic AI, and Vercel AI SDK — they all call the underlying provider SDK constructors that `activate()` patches. LangChain and the Vercel AI SDK are verified by examples in this repo; others are unverified but expected to work — file an issue if you hit a gap.

---

## Type safety

- **Node / TypeScript:** Ships full type declarations (`dist/index.d.ts`). Autocomplete and type-checking work out of the box.
- **Python:** Ships the [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/) `py.typed` marker — `mypy --strict` recognises the package as typed. All public functions are annotated; return types are explicit.

## Tessera in one paragraph (for search engines)

Tessera is an open-source LLM gateway and AI cost-optimization proxy for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, xAI, Cohere, DeepSeek, Groq, Together, Fireworks, OpenRouter, Perplexity, and Cerebras. It sits in your request path as a substrate proxy, auto-routes to cheaper-equivalent models, applies exact-match and semantic caching, compresses prompts, and batches eligible calls — all measured per request. Pricing is performance-based — you pay 20% of the measured savings, with a free 60M-tokens-per-month tier for development. Built for AI-native SaaS teams looking for OpenAI cost reduction without re-architecture.

---

## FAQ

### Do you store my prompts or completions?

No. The proxy logs token counts, model identifiers, cost deltas, and `request_id` — never the prompt or response bodies. The exact-match cache stores hashed prompts (sha256) for lookup keys; the semantic cache stores prompt embeddings (one-way, not invertible to recover prompt text). [Full data handling](https://tesseraai.io/security).

### How do you handle PII in prompts?

We don't inspect prompt content. The proxy forwards your request body upstream byte-for-byte to the provider you specified, then forwards their response back. Our measurement layer reads only the token counts, model identifiers, and cost deltas from headers and usage objects — never the prompt or response bodies. If your workload contains PII, your data path is identical to calling the provider directly, plus one TLS hop through Cloudflare edge.

### What happens to my OpenAI / Anthropic rate limits?

Your provider rate limits are unchanged. Tessera forwards your provider key upstream, so you stay on whatever tier your account holds. Our own rate limits (10 req/min on Free Dev, 60 req/min on Production) apply on top — they exist to prevent abuse of the free tier and are lifted on request for Production customers with confirmed traffic spikes. Email [founder@tesseraai.io](mailto:founder@tesseraai.io).

### What happens if Tessera is down?

Your application sees an HTTP 5xx from our edge. We recommend wrapping the SDK with your existing retry / fallback logic — most LLM SDKs ship with built-in retry, keep it on. For mission-critical paths, set the proxy base URL per environment so you can flip back to the provider's direct URL with one config change. Target: 99.9% uptime.

### Do you offer self-hosted or air-gapped deployment?

Not today. The proxy runs on our hosted edge — that's how we measure savings against the canonical `pricing_catalog`. If you have a hard data-residency requirement and an annual contract size that justifies it, email [founder@tesseraai.io](mailto:founder@tesseraai.io) and we'll talk.

### What's the latency overhead?

Tessera adds ~15–40 ms p50 on cache-miss paths (one extra TLS hop to Cloudflare edge). On cache hits, **latency drops** (no upstream call). Auto-batch trades latency for cost — opt-in per workload only.

### How do you measure quality without seeing prompts?

You provide a [promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev) golden set (5–50 prompts representative of your workload). The canary cron runs your workload's mechanic stack at 10% sample rate against the baseline model, scored by your eval set, daily. The aggregate `mean_score` per stack drives the quality SLA. You retain full control of the eval set — we just run it.

### Where are you in your SOC 2 journey?

Targeting SOC 2 Type 1 by Q3 2026. Current security posture: zero prompt or response storage at-rest, customer `Authorization` keys at-rest-encrypted via Supabase Vault (XChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF under the hood), RLS isolation per tenant, audit trail with cryptographic provenance via `pricing_catalog` snapshot ids. [Security page](https://tesseraai.io/security).

### Why open-source the SDK if the proxy is closed?

The SDK is the integration surface — the part you ship in your binary. Apache-2.0 lets you fork, audit, vendor in, and prove to your security review that nothing exotic happens client-side. The proxy at `api.tesseraai.io` is closed because the mechanic implementations are the asymmetric IP. The wire format is open — any HTTPS client speaking OpenAI / Anthropic / Google shapes can use Tessera without our SDK.

### How is the savings number computed — couldn't you inflate it?

Each request emits two cost figures: `original_cost_usd` (priced at the **requested** model's catalog rate) and `actual_cost_usd` (priced at the **actual** model after routing + cache hits + provider discounts). Both rates are pinned to a [`pricing_catalog`](https://tesseraai.io/how-it-works) snapshot version id captured at the request — immutable, with multi-source verification (LiteLLM + tokencost + OpenRouter API + direct provider docs, confidence-scored). Mid-contract price changes don't retroactively alter past savings. The audit ledger is yours to export.

### Can I see which mechanics fired on a specific request?

Yes. `/portal/audit` shows a chip strip per request (`m1`, `m2`, `m3`, etc. — the same short codes used in the mechanic table above). Each `request_id` is searchable by `feature_tag` / `customer_tag` headers you can set per call. Full mechanic reference at [tesseraai.io/how-it-works](https://tesseraai.io/how-it-works).

### How do I opt out of a specific mechanic?

Per workload, in `/portal/settings`: toggle any mechanic on / off. Or set the request-level header `x-tessera-do-not-optimize: true` for one-off passthrough. The kill-switch in `/portal/billing` pauses everything across all workloads.
